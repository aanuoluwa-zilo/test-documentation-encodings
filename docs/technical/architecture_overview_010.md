# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of our system's architecture, including the technology stack, component relationships, and design principles that guide our development.

## Architecture Principles
Our system is built on several key principles:
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growth in users and data
- **Reliability**: High availability and fault tolerance
- **Security**: Comprehensive security measures at all layers
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code and architecture
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: Styled Components and CSS Modules
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js with NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Redis caching
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **API**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: AWS with auto-scaling
- **CDN**: CloudFront for static assets
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and DataDog
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration

## System Components

### 1. User Interface Layer
The frontend application provides the user interface and handles:
- User interactions and form submissions
- State management and data flow
- Responsive design and accessibility
- Client-side validation and error handling

### 2. API Gateway
Acts as the entry point for all client requests:
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning and backward compatibility

### 3. Authentication Service
Handles user authentication and authorization:
- User registration and login
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### 4. Business Logic Layer
Contains the core application logic:
- Domain models and business rules
- Data validation and processing
- Business workflow orchestration
- Integration with external services
- Error handling and logging

### 5. Data Access Layer
Manages data persistence and retrieval:
- Database connection management
- Query optimization and caching
- Data migration and versioning
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Data integrity and consistency

### 6. External Services
Integration with third-party services:
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Email delivery (SendGrid)
- File storage (AWS S3)
- Analytics (Google Analytics)
- Monitoring (Sentry)

## Data Flow

### Request Processing
1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. Gateway validates authentication and authorization
3. Request is routed to appropriate service
4. Business logic processes the request
5. Data layer retrieves or persists data
6. Response is formatted and returned to client

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for session and frequently accessed data
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for documents and media
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities
- **Analytics**: Data warehouse for reporting and analytics

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Refresh token rotation for security
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management and timeout

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Resource-level permissions
- API endpoint protection
- Data access controls

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure communication protocols (HTTPS/TLS)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session and application cache
- CDN for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Browser caching for static resources

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database read replicas
- Microservices architecture
- Auto-scaling based on demand

### Monitoring
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User experience monitoring

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local development with Docker
- Feature branch workflow
- Automated testing pipeline
- Code review process

### Staging Environment
- Production-like environment
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- User acceptance testing

### Production Environment
- High availability setup
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting

## Future Considerations
- Microservices migration
- Event-driven architecture
- GraphQL API implementation
- Real-time features with WebSockets
- Machine learning integration
- Mobile application development
